<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Research and Development Engineer at <img alt="bytedance" src="./assets/img/bytedance-logo.svg" style="width: 1em;"> [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/). I received my M.S. in Computer Science at <img alt="fudan" src="./assets/img/fudan_logo.png" style="width: 1em;"> [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanwei Fu](http://yanweifu.github.io/) and [Prof. Xiangyang Xue](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=DTbhX6oAAAAJ). I was also lucky to be mentored by [Dr. Yinda Zhang](https://www.zhangyinda.com/) from 2018 to 2021.
Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from <img alt="uestc" src="./assets/img/uestc_logo.png" style="width: 1em;"> [UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/).

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **computer graphics** -- with a special focus on building a virtual representation of physical objects, person and environment. My research interests include **3D reconstruction**, **neural rendering**, and **digital human**.
